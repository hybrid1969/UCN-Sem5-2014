%We had reply to our question that we found somewhat reliable, from a person who got a entry level job at EA in San Francisco. His estimated time was 30 minutes per level at a rate of 13\$ a hour. However an interesting side note he added was that the work estimates go up exponentially the more detail that is needed to be putted into a level's design, as well as the required skill from the level artist.
