\chapter{Conclusion}
The problem statement focused on how to make a IRLVRMMO, and how this could mimic popular PC games. Some topics have been discussed about how it could be implemented but have been excluded from the project itself to focus on other central areas, that is combining the real world with a game world.

We have made an android game using a Google map overlay as a game board with drawn player objects to emulate a capture the flag game, where the players position is updated by using GPS data. The players can interact with some objects when getting close to them, to pick up the flag or capture it.

Additionally this game is made to be played online, together with a group of friends and with a server communication between the players, to always get notified about player's movement, which may lead to tactical play for each team in order to win the game.

The game we have made mimics a capture the flag game, or mini game, which is used today in a bunch of games as a tactical team based game where 2 teams need to capture each others flag to score points for their team. Usually there is some sort of combat involved in such game which we currently have not implemented in our version due to limitations which is addressed in chapter \ref{cha:FutureWork}.
