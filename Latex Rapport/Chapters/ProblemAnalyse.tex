\section{Problem Analysis}

Video games today is for many a daily part of their everyday life. Most games' target platform is computers or consoles, but with the new technology we have, it's about time to find out how we can implement such games in new ways that can make the players interact with the game world in a whole new way. 

As many people play video games on a daily basis, both social life and communication with other people outside the game as well as exercise may become a minor part of their everyday life. An article from 2010\cite{latimes} says that kids and teens in America spend over 7 hours a day on either TV, Video Games or Computer, and has been increasing by almost 2,25 hours since 2004. It may be discussed if there is the same tendencies in other countries and age groups, but regardless it seems that there in some parts of the world are these problems.

The newer technology, that some call In Real Life Virtual Reality Massive Multiplayer Online or IRLVRMMO for short, takes advantage of the real world we live in and a smartphone, to create an illusion of a game world within the real life world. The game adds  different tasks and goals to complete, while moving around physically in the world we live in. This way a player can both play the game, get exercise and get in physical contact with people that is playing with you. This does that the player also explores the world first hand instead of from behind the screen.
