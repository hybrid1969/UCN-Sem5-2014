\chapter{Future Work}
\label{cha:FutureWork}

For a project this big there is often much more that could have been done, but due to limited time we excluded some features that could have been developed in the future. 

A combat system is maybe the prime feature missing in the game. The idea was first to use the gyroscope to simulate shooting at some direction using a vector related to the real world and then use it like a trace line, or ray cast. We later stumble over the problem with such a system is that you could be able to shoot directly through houses and other solid structures unless we segmented the map and looked at whether a ray or trace line would hit a structure, and even though this was a possibility, making a very precise collision detection system would be a task too large to complete within the time limit. Another option would be to use infra red, but at this time fewer phones come with a built in infra red sender/receiver. Alternatively an infrared gun such as those shown in chapter \ref{cha:Accessories}.

If the game should function as a MMO the server would need much more work and have implemented a similar network communication as the one explained in chapter \ref{cha:MMO}

Additional if the game should be optimized to function as a MMO the game would probably be much different and mechanic wise be a whole other game, where capture the flag could be an optional mini game each team could compete against each other in. Other points of interest could probably be added to the game too, to make it even more appealing for the players, e.g. Quests, Open world player versus player, and other mechanics that players could find appealing in a MMO.
