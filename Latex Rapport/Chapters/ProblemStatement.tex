\section{Problem Statement}

From the problem analysis we can see that people sometimes are more willing to explore the world from behind the screen rather than exploring it first hand. This may also lead to other problems amongst those people such as isolation and/or obesity which can again lead to other problems such as bullying, anxiety or other health issues.

This has led to the following problem statements:

\begin{itemize}
\item How can the real world be used as a game world?
\item How can such game be both cooperative and competitive and implement task or goals for the players to complete?
\item Is it possible to mimic popular video games in a IRLVRMMO?
\end{itemize}
