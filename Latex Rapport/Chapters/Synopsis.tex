This report covers the development of a procedural content generator, that can be used in a game to create worlds. Procedural content generation is an algorithmic way of automatically generating content, rather than creating it by hand. We will in this report look into Procedural content generation, its applications as well as the steps and technologies used to create a procedural content generator. We will look into how noise can be used to generate game worlds and how we have implemented this into a prototype of a game. Lastly we will conclude our project and talk about future work that could be interesting to look at too but fell outside the scope of our main focus area.
